Project basis on using MQTT broker and NoderRd where we are trying to link different devices into the control on a single dashboard. 

## The design
The design have been completely done on NodeRed as the attached flows file. 

There is need to link a sensor device or a component to the pc to act as a control. 
The dashboard can helkp in regulating the temperature of a room, the music in the house and among others. The peration can best get comapred with the Home Assitant tool. 
Additionally, it can regulate the company manufacturing line.
